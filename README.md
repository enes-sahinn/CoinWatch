## About The Project
CoinWatch is a native Android application that integrates with the CoinRanking API to display cryptocurrency data. The app features a Home Screen that lists various coins with key details like price, market cap, 24h volume, and change percentage, and a Detail Screen showing in-depth information along with historical price charts. The project follows modern Android development practices, using MVVM architecture, Jetpack Compose for UI, Room for local data storage, Retrofit for networking, Hilt for dependency injection, and MPAndroidChart for charting.
